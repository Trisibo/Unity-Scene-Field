Scene Field
===========

Extension for Unity that allows directly assigning scenes in the Inspector. At runtime, the build index of the scene can be retrieved to, for example, load the scene, without hard-coding or maintaining a list of scene paths. Using this field, the scene info will always be updated even when changing its name, folder, or build index. It's as lightweight as possible, and uses a simple custom inspector.

There are 3 sections in the inspector:

*   The slot with the scene asset, similar to any other asset selector in Unity.
*   A text indicating whether the assigned scene is added to builds. Appears in red if the "Required" checkbox is set.
*   A checkbox to indicate whether a scene that exists in builds must be assigned. If it isn't, builds will fail, and an error will appear in the editor when trying to get the scene build index.

The inspector correctly supports editing multiple objects, and the standard bold labels when overriding the fields in prefab instances.



Usage
-----

To add a SceneField to a script, just use the `SceneField` class for the field, which is inside the `Trisibo` namespace:

    using UnityEngine;
    using Trisibo;
    
    public class Test : MonoBehaviour
    {
        [SerializeField] SceneField sceneThingy;
    }

At runtime, you can access the build index of the scene using the `SceneField.BuildIndex` property:

    SceneManager.LoadScene(sceneThingy.BuildIndex);
