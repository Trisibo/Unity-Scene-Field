Scene Field
===========

Extension for Unity that allows directly assigning scenes in the Inspector. At runtime, the build index of the scene can be retrieved to, for example, load the scene, without hard-coding or maintaining a list of scene paths. Using this field, the scene info will always be updated even when changing its name, folder, or build index. It's as lightweight as possible, and uses a simple custom inspector.

There are 3 sections in the inspector:

*   The slot with the scene asset, similar to any other asset selector in Unity.
*   A text indicating the build index of the scene. If no scene is selected, "-" will appear, and if the scene is not included in builds, the index "-1" will be shown, with the label in red.
*   A checkbox to enable logging errors in the Unity console if the scene is not included in builds. This is to prevent mistakes, so, when building, the errors will appear in the console if the scene is not going to be added to builds. Unfortunately, in the current version the builds won't be stopped, and when the inspector is visible the log entry will be spammed many times in the console.

The inspector correctly supports editing multiple objects, and the standard bold labels when overriding the fields in prefab instances.



Usage
-----

To add a SceneField to a script, just use the `SceneField` class for the field, which is inside the `Trisibo` namespace:

    using UnityEngine;
    using Trisibo;
    
    public class Test : MonoBehaviour
    {
        [SerializeField] SceneField sceneThingy;
    }

At runtime, you can access the build index of the scene using the `SceneField.BuildIndex` property:

    SceneManager.LoadScene(sceneThingy.BuildIndex);
